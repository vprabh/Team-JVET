# Team-JVET

This is a repository for our group that is developing a system that can monitor various environmental factors that directly impact local agriculture and air quality. The data collected will be used to assist the town council in making informed decisions about agricultural guidelines and urban management policies. This is apart of a class project in AP Computer Science - Python.
